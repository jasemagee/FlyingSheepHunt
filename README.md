FlyingSheepHunt
===============

### Overview


Flying Sheep Hunt is a simple game built using Ruby and Gosu. The objective is to survive as long as you can by not letting any flying sheep escape. You lose a point every time a sheep escapes unscathed and after enough have escaped you lose the game.  Every couple of seconds the difficulty increases, causing sheep to move faster and spawn more frequently. Your total score is built up as you go and your score per kill is multiplied by the difficulty.

### Controls
